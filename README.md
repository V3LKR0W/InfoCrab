Crabber.net API testing
Code is buggy but works. Tried my best explaining the logic behind it.

# Currently known bugs:
- When bot restarts it replies to all previous posts, ideally the bot would be hosted on a server and it would be unlikely for the server to ever reboot. If hosted on a server I'd host an instance of mongodb and just save the previous post ID to the DB heck even a .json file. So maybe in the future whenever i have more idea's all add that support.
